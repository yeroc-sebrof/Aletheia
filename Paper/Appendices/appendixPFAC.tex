\section{Iterations of the PFAC algorithm}
\label{sec:PFACappendix}

\subsection{Code}
Overall the code that drive the Aletheia Header/Footer search can be seen in the final Git hub project:
\underline{\href{https://github.com/yeroc-sebrof/Aletheia}{here}} or through the link https://github.com/yeroc-sebrof/Aletheia

The code that contains the fully integrated CPU method is contained within a folder within the Aletheia Git hub project;

\href{https://github.com/yeroc-sebrof/Aletheia/blob/master/Prod/Previous/MultiCPU.cpp}{yeroc-sebrof/Aletheia/blob/master/Prod/Previous/MultiCPU.cpp}

This code currently runs on multiple CPU threads.
This method was able to be run in a single thread also by un-commenting line 181 and 203, and commenting line 177, 178, 183, 184, 189, 199, 200, 205, 206, and 211.

\subsection{Results}
Due to the time taken for this search on the CPU it was deemed reasonable to conduct the tests with a smaller number of run times.
Testing of the single threaded PFAC file header search was extremely slow and was only run twice to confirm the first result given.
The multi-threaded PFAC search obviously improved upon this design and was able to demonstrate performance gains.
This was only run run 10 times however.

The test here makes use of the 400MB test case from Section \ref{sec:AllFileTypes} and can be compared to the results in \ref{sec:400MBAppendixResults}.
Test results averaged to:
