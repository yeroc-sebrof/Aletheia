I would like to thank my Supervisor, Dr Ethan Bayne for his continued help and support throughout the research put into this paper.
Being able to work with your in-depth subject knowledge helped shape this work and the -- what appeared infinite -- supply of advice I was given throughout the course of this research was invaluable to its success and in some cases my sanity.\\

Next, to all of the staff of Abertay University in the School of Design and Informatics I would like to thank you all for the incredible opportunity I have made my life for the past 4 years.
The opportunities I have had access to have been invaluable to my constant wish for self improvement.\\

I would also like to thank all of the family and friends, old and new, who have shown their love and support shaping me into the person I have become during the time of my studies.
The changes I have seen in myself from the start of my time at Abertay have been considerable and I appreciate all the help along the way.
I would like to especially thank my partner Mairi who sat with me in the week up to my deadline to read through my frantic writings and provided far more help than Grammarly ever could.
